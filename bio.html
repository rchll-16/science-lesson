        <h1>BIODIVERSITY</h1>
        <p><b>Biodiversity</b> is a broad term for biological variety, and it can be measured at a number of organizational levels. 
            It refers to every living thing, including plants, bacteria, animals, and humans.

        <h2>Types of Biodiversity</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Genetic and Chemical</h4>
                <p>Genetic diversity (or variation) is the raw material for adaptation in a species.
                    Differencces of DNA among the individuals.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Ecosystems</h4>
                <p>The number of different ecosystems on Earth or in a geographical area.
                    Variety of habitats, ecosystems, and communities.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Current Species</h4>
                <p>The number of kind of species being found. Variety of species in a given area.

        <h2>Patterns of Biodiversity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Species vary globally</li>
            <p>In this pattern of biodiversity, species living in similar ecosystems but in different
                parts of the world make them distantly related as they act and look quite similar.
            </p>
            <li>Species vary locally</li>
            <p>In this pattern of animal biodiversity, species different often occupy habitals area
                within a local.
            </p>
            <li>Species vary overtime</li>
            <p>By the studies of fossils, it was found that some were enormous versions of modern-day 
                species.\
            </p>
            <li>Patterns in Space</li>
            <p>Latitudinal gradients: Species  diversity  is  maximum  near  the equator and 
                decreases as we move away from the equator towards the pole. It means biodiversity is 
                more at lower latitude near the equator and less at higher latitude near poles.
            </p>
            <li>Patterns in Time</li>
            <p>Seasonal Pattern: During different seasons, the diversity of species varies. In the 
                rainy season, the diversity of insect species increased and decreased during winter. Bird 
                diversity is related to the migratory activity and breeding season. <br>
                Successional Pattern: After a disturbance, plants and animal species begin to reoccupy 
                the habitat. They grow and get replaced by other species. This pattern of the temporal shift 
                in the species composition of a community is called succession. <br>
                Evolutionary Pattern: Over 600 million years of animal evolution, increasing biodiversity 
                have been found over each regime and era. Some animals have been extinct, some are still found as 
                living fossils, and some are represented as missing links or existing links in the history of evolution.
            </p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Biogeography</h2>
        <p><b>Biogeography</b> is the study of the distribution of the worldâ€™s species both in the past and in the present.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ecolological biogeography</li>
            <p>Studies  the  current factors  affecting  the  distribution of  plants  and animals.</p>
            <li>Historical biogeography</li>
            <p>Studies the past distribution of species.</p>
            <li>Conservation biogeography</li>
            <p>Focused on the protection and restoration of species based upon the known historical and current ecological information.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance of Biodiversity</h2>
        <h3>Human Health</h3>
        <p>Many medications are derived from natural chemicals made by a diverse group of organisms. For example, many plants produce secondary 
            plant compounds, which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them. Some of these secondary 
            plant compounds also work as human medicines.
        </p>
        <h3>Agricultural</h3>
        <p>Since the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding and selecting crop varieties. 
            This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of humans. For example, potatoes were domesticated 
            beginning around 7,000 years ago in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia.
        </p>
        <h3>Wild Food Sources</h3>
        <p>Humans obtain food resources from wild populations, primarily wild fish populations. For about one billion people, aquatic resources 
            provide the main source of animal protein.
