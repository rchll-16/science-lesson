        <h1>Environmental Science</h1>
        <p>It is the study of the environment' the Processes it undergoes, and the problems that arise generally  
            from the interaction of humans with the environment. <br><br>
            In environmental science, environmental concerns such as global warming, air and water pollution  
            hazardous wastes proliferation, garbage problems, and depletion of biodiversity and other natural  
            resources are studied.

                <h4>Thomas Robert Malthus</h4>
                <p>He published his thoughts and studies in "An Essay on the Principle of Population" in 1798, he made many people think 
                    about how the population affects the environment. Malthus described population growth as exponential. Many people disagreed with Malthus, particularly on the scenario where the Earth would not be able to provide for the 
                    exponentially growing population. The use of fertilizers and pesticides increased the production of crops. However, with the control of many pests,
                    harmless species were affected.

                <h4>Rachel Carson</h4>
                <p>An American scientist and writer, was disturbed by the use of synthetic chemical pesticides. In her book Silent Spring 
                    (1962), she gravely expressed fears about what the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) Was doing to the 
                    environment. A trained biologist, Carson knew what the chemical did to the  birds' the eggshells thinned, and consequently, the birds 
                    did not develop. dreaded the effects of the chemical to other species.

                <h4>Garrett Hardin</h4>
                <p>An American ecologist, published an I essay called "Tragedy of the Commons" in the journal Science. He wrote that common 
                    property resources belong to no one in particular, but are used and exploited by everyone. Hardin was not only concerned with land exploitation. Air and water are also being polluted and degraded when every 
                    individual believes that what he does to the environment does not really matter because he is just one person.

        <p>An individual who promotes environmental awareness and advocates for the protection of the environment.</p>

        <h3>ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST</h3>
        <p>A specialist who studies, collects, and analyzes data pertaining to environmental conditions and problems.</p>

        <h3>ECOLOGY in Environmental Science</h3>
        <p>The study of the environment is always associated with ecology. It is one of the important disciplines which we use in 
            learning environment. Environmental science applies the scientific theories and concepts studied in other disciplines. <br><br>
            Ecology is a science which studies the relationships between humans and other organisms, and their environment. The word 
            ecology is derived from the word “oikos”, which means "house," and logos, which means "study".
        </p>
        
        <h3>ECOLOGICAL CONCEPTS</h3>
        <p>A basic ecological unit is the ecosystem which is described as a community of organisms within an area where matter cycles 
            and energy flows. Its living component is known as biotic component, while its nonliving or abiotic component includes all 
            the things which help living things survive. The abiotic component in an ecosystem determines the kind of organisms which 
            thrive in it. A species is made up of the same kind of organisms.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individuals</li>
            <p>A single organism being as distinct from a group or class</p>
            <li>Population</li>
            <p>All the inhabitants of a particular.</p>
            <li>Community</li>
            <p>A group of organisms living in the same place or having a particular characteristics in common.</p>
            <li>Ecosystem</li>
            <p>A biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment</p>
            <li>Landscape</li>
            <p>Heterogenous are consisting of distinctive patches organized into a mosaic-like pattern</p>
            <li>Region</li>
            <p>An area or division having definable characteristics but not always fixed boundaries</p>
            <li>Biosphere</li>
            <p>It consists of all living organisms</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>SOME ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES</h3>
        <p>Individuals in a population have genetic diversity. With variations in genetic makeup, individuals react differently to different 
            factors. This shows that individuals react differently to the abiotic component of an ecosystem. For a population, there is a 
            range of tolerance which could be applied. The population will thrive in a given ecosystem if the level of abiotic factors falls 
            within the range of tolerance applicable to its individuals. This is called the <u>law of tolerance</u>.
        </p>
        <p>There are abiotic factors, physical or chemical, which could limit the growth of a population. This principle is called the 
            <u>principle of limiting factor</u>. Examples of limiting factors are temperature, sunshine, amount of oxygen, or nutrients which 
            could increase or decrease the population in an ecosystem. Abiotic factors which are of excessive quantities can also be 
            limiting factors. Many fish pens in Luzon are found to be over rich with nutrients. When the water does not flow and the fish 
            nutrients accumulate, toxic substances are produced and are eaten by the fish. This results to massive fish kills. Nutrient 
            overload is a limiting factor.
